  "readme": "# Flow for Atom IDE (ide-flowtype)\n\n[Flow-typed JavaScript](https://flow.org/) support for Atom IDE, powered by [the Flow Language Server](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-language-server).\n\n![Autocomplete Flow-typed JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype/master/resources/autocomplete.gif)\n\nExtracted from Nuclide, Flow for Atom IDE brings all of the features you need to be productive with Flow-typed JavaScript into Atom.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Notice** Currently, you must also have the `atom-ide-ui` package (the core of Atom IDE) installed in order to take advantage of `ide-flowtype`. We're working with the Atom team to streamline this process.\n\nFind `ide-flowtype` in the Atom package installer by opening Atom's **Settings**, navigating to **Install**, and searching for `ide-flowtype`. Or maybe you're here inside Atom already.\n\nIf you have Atom's command line utilities, installation is also just a matter of:\n`apm install atom-ide-ui && apm install ide-flowtype`\n\n**Windows is not currently fully supported. This is being actively worked on.**\n\n## What is Atom IDE?\n\nAtom IDE brings the core features you expect in a full-featured IDE into Atom, such as language-aware autocomplete, diagnostics,  go-to-definition, type hints, symbol outlines, and more.\n\nAtom IDE is extracted from [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) and is brought to you in partnership by GitHub and Facebook.\n\nAtom IDE is also a standard protocol within Atom, so you can replace hackable pieces of UI and language integration with your favorites.\n\n## Flow for Atom IDE Features\n\n### Flow Version Management\n\nFlow for Atom understands the version of flow you have on your system, as well `flow-bin` in your `package.json` (enable this in settings).\n\nOtherwise, versions of flow are automatically downloaded, updated, and run transparently. This means you can create a `.flowconfig` for your project and get to work right away.\n\n### Autocomplete\n\n![Autocomplete Flow-typed JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype/master/resources/autocomplete.gif)\n\nSuggestions directly from the flow server are prioritized in autocomplete. Return types and complex type definitions shown right along suggestions.\n\n### Diagnostics\n\n![Real-time Diagnostics show errors as you code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype/master/resources/diagnostics.gif)\n\nSee problems directly in your code the second you hit save. No need to run your code, and no need to flip to your terminal to run `flow`. Instead, Flow for Atom IDE underscores problems as you code. You can even process large sets of problems at once with the bottom diagnostics pane.\n\n### Go to Definition\n\nWant to know how some of your JavaScript works under the hood? Hover over a symbol and hold ⌘ (Mac) or ctrl (Windows and Linux). You'll get a preview of the definition right away, and getting there is only a click away.\n\n### Type Hints\n\nHover over a symbol and get instant feedback for what you're looking at. Flow even shows you types it can infer without any effort on your part.\n\n![Hover for type-hints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype/master/resources/typehint.png)\n\n### Outline\n\nGet a birds-eye view of your JavaScript with an outline of the document's symbols, and click to jump right where you need to be.\n\n![Outline symbols in code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowtype/ide-flowtype/master/resources/outline.png)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)\n\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n### Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\")\n\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need\nto do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.\n\nComplete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>\n\n## License\n\nide-flowtype is BSD licensed.
